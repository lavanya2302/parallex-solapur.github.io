		<h1>Solapur</h1>

	<p>
	
			Solapur has a unique and important place in the history of Indian freedom struggle. The citizens of Solapur tasted the freedom before independence, though only for three days from 9 to 11 May 1930.
			
			It is believed that Solapur is derived from two words; ‘Sola’, which means sixteen and ‘pur’, which means village. It was considered that Solapur city was spread over sixteen villages including Ahmedur, Aadilpur, Fatehpur, Chapaldev, Kalaijapur, Jamarwadi, Khadarpur, Muhammadpur, Khandervkiwadi, Sandalpur, Ranapur, Shaikpur, Solapur, Sonapur, Vaidakwadi, and Sonalagi.
			
			Let us brief the history like this. When Gandhiji was arrested in May 1930, protests were held throughout India against British rule. The masses conducted large-scale rallies and protests, in which many were killed in police shootouts. This had an agitated reaction and the furious mob attacked the police stations. Looking at the chaotic situation, the Congress Party leaders had to take the responsibility of maintaining the law, order and security of citizens. Senior leader Tulsidas Jadhav along with other congressmen took this responsibility for three days from 9 to 11 May 1930. Tourists today can see a statue of Shri Tulsidas Jadhav, which was built in February 2009, at Mechanic Chowk.

		<h1> Shri Siddharameshwar</h1>
	</section>
	<p>
		History of Solapur is not completed without mentioning Shri Siddharameshwar, who was a historical figure of the 12th century. Shri Sidharam was a great saint, who preached the teachings of Shri Basaweshwara. A young girl, who was inspired by the teachings of Shri Sidharam, wanted to marry him. But, he denied her request and gave permission to marry his Yogadanda.
	
		People in Solapur celebrated the same marriage function every year for three days on Bhogi, Sankrat and Kinkrant. This festival, which is known as Gadda Jatra, falls around January 14th every year and lasts for fifteen days during this period. Sidharama, who is considered as one of the six prophets of Lingayat religion, was a great contributor to this religion. He entombed himself alive at Solapur.

		The city has many places of worship and holds great value to Hindus across the country. It has temples that are not only important in Solapur, but in all of Maharashtra. Some of the significant temples situated in and at a short distance away from Solapur include the Shree Swami Samarth Maharaj Temple, where the Samadhi of Swami Samarthji lies, the Siddeshwar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiddeshwar, who has forms of both Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu, the Vithoba Temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, the beautifully created Vishnupad Temple, the Vitthal Temple, the Pundalik Temple and the Malikarjuna Temple, among others.
		Apart from temples, the city has the Bhuikot Fort, which was built back in the 14th century and is one of the few forts built on flat land. This is how the name was derived as ‘bhui’ means flat and ‘kot’ means fort.
